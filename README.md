WebSocket Projects Hub

This is a hub of all the WebSocket projects I built while learning how WebSockets work.
Each project is simple, experimental, and focuses on mastering real-time communication between client and server.

📌 Projects
1. Global Chat

A single public chatroom — just open the link, and you’re in.

One-click chat vanish → hit purge and your local UI clears instantly.

One-click login → enter a username, and you’re registered with the server.

⚠️ This is not production-ready. It’s meant purely for learning.
There’s no authentication, no persistence — everything is temporary.

I'm building more and more projects in the coming weeks, will update all of theme here and also on my x (x.com/piyushkkr)
